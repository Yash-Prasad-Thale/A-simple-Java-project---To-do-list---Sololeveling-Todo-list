# A-simple-Java-project---To-do-list---Sololeveling-Todo-list

This project is started by me in order to motivate myself into studying by making a To-Do list that will help me focus more on studying by converting completing my tasks into a game.
Technical info:
(i). Features I have decided to add:
1. I have decided to use a ArrayList as a storage(Temporary) for "Tasks".
2. A 'AddTask()' function to "Add a task to the To-Do list".
3. A 'Cancle()' function to "Cancle a task incase a user creates a task by mistake".
4. A 'Done()' function to "Mark a task completed and remove it from 'Tasks' and add +5 to user's score. " 
5.
